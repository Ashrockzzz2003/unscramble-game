# Word Unscramble Game

## Description

This is a simple, interactive single-file web application (HTML, CSS, JS) designed to help users, particularly children, learn positive phrases and moral values.

Sentences related to moral values are presented with the letters within each word jumbled, while maintaining the original word order in the sentence. Users can drag and drop the letters or type directly into the provided text box below each word to unscramble it and reconstruct the original phrase. The game provides immediate feedback on correctness and includes options to show the solution or reset the game.

## Demo

The game displays several sentences, each on its own line within a card-like container. Each word in the sentence appears as a set of jumbled letter tiles above an input box. Users can:

-   Drag and drop the orange letter tiles within a word's container to reorder them.
-   Type the unscrambled word directly into the input box below the tiles (typing will also attempt to reorder the tiles above).
-   Click the "Check Answers" button to see which words are correct (highlighted green and locked) and incorrect (highlighted red).
-   Click the "Show Solution" button for a specific sentence to reveal the answer and lock that sentence.
-   Click the Reset icon (ðŸ”„) in the header to reload the game.
